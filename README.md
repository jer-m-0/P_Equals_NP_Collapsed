## Overview

This project contains the formal structural collapse of the P vs NP problem. Rather than offering an algorithmic improvement, this paper dissolves the distinction between solution and verification by exposing their identity within fully closed constraint systems.

Collapse is not computed. It is the removal of contradiction across a fully entangled constraint space. The survivor structure that remains is not selected or guessed—it is what cannot be eliminated.
